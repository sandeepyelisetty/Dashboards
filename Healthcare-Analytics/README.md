This project analyzes a synthetic Healthcare dataset from Kaggle and transforms it into an interactive, insights-driven Power BI dashboard.
The solution provides a full 360° view of patient population, billing trends, medical conditions, payer performance, hospital activity, and doctor efficiency — similar to dashboards used by health plans (Cigna, Medicare, UnitedHealthcare) and provider organizations.

Using a BI industry-standard approach, the dataset was cleaned, modeled using a star schema, and enriched through DAX measures to support drill-downs, segmentation, and year-over-year financial analysis.
