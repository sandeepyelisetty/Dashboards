# 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project analyzes a synthetic Healthcare dataset from Kaggle and transforms it into an **interactive, insights-driven Power BI dashboard**.

The solution provides a full **360° view** of patient population, billing trends, medical conditions, payer performance, hospital activity, and doctor efficiency — similar to dashboards used by health plans (Cigna, Medicare, UnitedHealthcare) and provider organizations.

Using a BI industry-standard approach, the dataset was **cleaned**, **modeled using a star schema**, and **enriched through DAX measures** to support drill-downs, segmentation, and year-over-year financial analysis.

#  INSIGHTS DISCOVERED

- **Arthritis ** are the highest-volume medical conditions.  
- **Cigna and Medicare** contribute the majority of payer billing.  
- **Emergency admissions** drive more than 50% of patient volume.  
- Patient gender distribution is nearly **balanced (≈50/50)**.  
- Billing **peaked in 2021–2023** and declined in 2024.  
- **Significant variation** exists in billing among top doctors and hospitals.
