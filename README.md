# ✅ **Recommended Folder Structure for Your Master Repo (Dashboards)**

You already have:

```
Dashboards/
```

Now organize it like this:

```
Dashboards/
│
├── Healthcare-Analytics/
│      ├── Healthcare-Analytics-Dashboard.pbix
│      ├── README.md
│      ├── dataset/
│      │       └── healthcare_dataset.csv
│      ├── screenshots/
│      │       ├── page1.png
│      │       └── page2.png
│      └── dax/
│              └── measures.txt
│
├── Sales-Analytics/
│      ├── Sales-Performance-Dashboard.pbix
